# station-entry-api

Java based project for storing data about Electrical Vehicle Charging Stations. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish this project in time. 

The sql schemas are generated via using  [data-generator](https://github.com/Nyuczka/data-generator) project. 

## TO-DO: 
1. Finish post mapping.
2. Add Unit tests.
