# station-entry-api

Java based project for storing data about Electrical Vehicle Charging Stations. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish this project in time. 
The rest will be added later this week. :( 

The sql schemas are generated via using  [data-generator](https://github.com/Nyuczka/data-generator) project. 

## TO-DO: 
1. Add JWT implementation.
2. Finish post mapping.
3. Add Unit tests.
4. Add docker-compose for exposing whole api connections.
